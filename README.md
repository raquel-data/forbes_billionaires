## Data Collection
This dataset, capturing insights into the world's billionaires, has been meticulously aggregated from the Forbes Billionaires List, further cross-referenced with publicly available financial documents, news sources, and industry publications.
Each year, Forbes employs a team of over 50 reporters from a variety of countries to track the activity of the world's wealthiest individuals. Preliminary surveys are sent to those who may qualify for the list. Business deals are then scrutinized and estimates of valuable assets are made. Interviews are conducted to vet the figures and improve the estimate of an individual's holdings. Finally, positions in a publicly traded stock are priced to market on a date roughly a month before publication. Known debt is subtracted from assets to get a final estimate of an individual's estimated worth in United States dollars. Since stock prices fluctuate rapidly, an individual's true wealth and ranking at the time of publication may vary from their situation when the list was compiled. The lists are shared and are of public domain. Here is the Forbes real time billionaire list. 

## Data Contents
This dataset contains statistics on the world's billionaires, including information about their businesses, industries, and personal details. It provides insights into the wealth distribution, business sectors, and demographics of billionaires worldwide. This includes:

## Yearly rankings.
Net worth details and evolution.
Personal details like names, age, gender, and birth dates.
Residence details spanning country, city, and citizenship.
In-depth business category and industry classifications.
Details about affiliations with various organizations, including positions held.
Indicators like "self-made" and the current wealth status.

## Data Limitations
According to Forbes, they received three types of responses to the preliminary surveys: some people try to inflate their wealth, others cooperate but leave out details, and some refuse to answer any questions. The data is therefore limited to cooperation. 

Royal families and dictators that have their wealth contingent on a position are always excluded from these lists.  

## Data Ethics
The data is consensual and it excludes fortunes from non democratic sources. Therefore there are no ethical concerns with the data. 

## Data Relevance
The dataset meets the project requirements of being recent, license, more than 2 categorical and numerical variables, at least 1500 rows, geographical data and data over time. 
The data is also diverse enough to cover a good analysis to understand the evolution and trajectories of the fortunes of the world’s billionaires. And examine the dynamics of wealth in relation to factors like age, gender or nationality.
